# LLM Fix Scripts

This folder contains self-executing shell scripts generated by LLMs to apply safe code fixes.

## Conventions
- **Backup**: All edits create `.bak` files for reversibility.
- **Risk Levels**:
  - Low-risk → safe to run directly.
  - High-risk → script prompts for confirmation before making edits.
- **Naming**: `YYYY-MM-DD_<short-description>.sh`

## Usage
```bash
cd tools/llm-fixes
chmod +x 2025-08-20_dashboard-normalization.sh
./2025-08-20_dashboard-normalization.sh
